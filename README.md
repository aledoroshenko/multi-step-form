# Multi-step form

State of current step managed by root component, state of current step form managed by Formik. On each next step interaction Formik validates and submits form, and re-renders with validation rules for a current step. There are several state-related parameters in root component to emulate async requests from the form. In real world scenario its better to use `useReducer`. A next possible step - to rework this form to XState.
